<h1>Microsoft Q# Coding Contest - Summer 2018 Solutions </h1>

These files contain the solution functions to the Warmup problem set of the Microsoft Q# Coding Contest - Summer 2018.

These problems are example problems for basic quantum algorithms written in the quantum computing programming language Q#. They contain subroutines such as the creation or identification of the bell states, comparisons of bitwise strings, and generation of oracles. 

Notably, the last problem (warmup9.qs) contains an implementation for the Deutsch-Jozsa Algorithm.
